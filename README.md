# FoodScore

FoodScore is an R dashboard designed to provide recommendations of the cleanest restaurants in New York City. FoodScore utilizes machine learning techniques such as a recommender system based on both Item Based Collarborative Filtering (IBCF) and User Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), as well as heatmaps, exploration of inspection violations, and capstone background for the Data Incubator summer 20' cohort.
